        <big>For every evil under the sun, there's an answer. It may be a
        simple, direct answer; it may be one that takes years, and seems
        unrelated to the problem. But there's an answer&mdash;of a kind....</big>

      President Folsom XXIV said petulantly to his Secretary of the Treasury:
      "Blow me to hell, Bannister, if I understood a single word of that. <i>Why</i>
      can't I buy the Nicolaides Collection? And don't start with the rediscount
      and the Series W business again. Just tell me <i>why</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Secretary of the Treasury said with an air of apprehension and a
      thread-like feeling across his throat: "It boils down to&mdash;no money,
      Mr. President."
    </p>
    <p>
      The President was too engrossed in thoughts of the marvelous collection to
      fly into a rage. "It's <i>such</i> a bargain," he said mournfully. "An
      archaic Henry Moore figure&mdash;really too big to finger, but I'm no
      culture-snob, thank God&mdash;and fifteen early Morrisons and I can't
      begin to tell you what else." He looked hopefully at the Secretary of
      Public Opinion: "Mightn't I seize it for the public good or something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Secretary of Public Opinion shook his head. His pose was gruffly
      professional. "Not a chance, Mr. President. We'd never get away with it.
      The art-lovers would scream to high Heaven."
    </p>
    <div class="figr">

    </div>
    <p>
      "I suppose so.... <i>Why</i> isn't there any money?" He had swiveled
      dangerously on the Secretary of the Treasury again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, purchases of the new Series W bond issue have lagged badly because
      potential buyers have been attracted to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop it, stop it, <i>stop</i> it! You know I can't make head or tail of
      that stuff. Where's the money <i>going</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Director of the Budget said cautiously: "Mr. President, during the
      biennium just ending, the Department of Defense accounted for 78 per cent
      of expenditures&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Secretary of Defense growled: "Now wait a minute, Felder! We were
      voted&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The President interrupted, raging weakly: "Oh, you rascals! My father
      would have known what to do with you! But don't think I can't handle it.
      <i>Don't</i> think you can hoodwink me." He punched a button ferociously;
      his silly face was contorted with rage and there was a certain tension on
      all the faces around the Cabinet table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Panels slid down abruptly in the walls, revealing grim-faced Secret
      Servicemen. Each Cabinet officer was covered by at least two automatic
      rifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take that&mdash;that traitor away!" the President yelled. His finger
      pointed at the Secretary of Defense, who slumped over the table, sobbing.
      Two Secret Servicemen half-carried him from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      President Folsom XXIV leaned back, thrusting out his lower lip. He told
      the Secretary of the Treasury: "<i>Get</i> me the money for the Nicolaides
      Collection. Do you understand? I don't care how you do it. <i>Get</i> it."
      He glared at the Secretary of Public Opinion. "Have you any comments?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Mr. President."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, then." The President unbent and said plaintively: "I don't see
      why you can't all be more reasonable. I'm a very reasonable man. I don't
      see why I can't have a few pleasures along with my responsibilities.
      Really I don't. And I'm sensitive. I don't <i>like</i> these scenes. Very
      well. That's all. The Cabinet meeting is adjourned."
    </p>
    <p>
      They rose and left silently in the order of their seniority. The President
      noticed that the panels were still down and pushed the button that raised
      them again and hid the granite-faced Secret Servicemen. He took out of his
      pocket a late Morrison fingering-piece and turned it over in his hand, a
      smile of relaxation and bliss spreading over his face. <i>Such</i> amusing
      textural contrast! <i>Such</i> unexpected variations on the classic
      sequences!
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The Cabinet, less the Secretary of Defense, was holding a rump meeting in
      an untapped corner of the White House gymnasium.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God," the Secretary of State said, white-faced. "Poor old Willy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The professionally gruff Secretary of Public Opinion said: "We should
      murder the bastard. I don't care what happens&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Director of the Budget said dryly: "We all know what would happen.
      President Folsom XXV would take office. No; we've got to keep plugging as
      before. Nothing short of the invincible can topple the Republic...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about a war?" the Secretary of Commerce demanded fiercely. "We've no
      proof that our program will work. What about a war?"
    </p>
    <p>
      State said wearily: "Not while there's a balance of power, my dear man.
      The Io-Callisto Question proved that. The Republic and the Soviet fell all
      over themselves trying to patch things up as soon as it seemed that there
      would be real shooting. Folsom XXIV and his excellency Premier Yersinsky
      know at least that much."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Secretary of the Treasury said: "What would you all think of Steiner
      for Defense?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Director of the Budget was astonished. "Would he take it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Treasury cleared his throat. "As a matter of fact, I've asked him to stop
      by right about now." He hurled a medicine ball into the budgetary gut.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oof!" said the Director. "You bastard. Steiner would be perfect. He runs
      Standards like a watch." He treacherously fired the medicine ball at the
      Secretary of Raw Materials, who blandly caught it and slammed it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here he comes," said the Secretary of Raw Materials. "Steiner! Come and
      sweat some oleo off!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Steiner ambled over, a squat man in his fifties, and said: "I don't mind
      if I do. Where's Willy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      State said: "The President unmasked him as a traitor. He's probably been
      executed by now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Steiner looked grim, and grimmer yet when the Secretary of the Treasury
      said, dead-pan: "We want to propose you for Defense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm happy in Standards," Steiner said. "Safer, too. The Man's father took
      an interest in science, but The Man never comes around. Things are very
      quiet. Why don't you invite Winch, from the National Art Commission? It
      wouldn't be much of a change for the worse for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No brains," the Secretary for Raw Materials said briefly. "Heads up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Steiner caught the ball and slugged it back at him. "What good are
      brains?" he asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Close the ranks, gentlemen," State said. "These long shots are too hard
      on my arms."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ranks closed and the Cabinet told Steiner what good were brains. He
      ended by accepting.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The Moon is all Republic. Mars is all Soviet. Titan is all Republic.
      Ganymede is all Soviet. But Io and Callisto, by the Treaty of Greenwich,
      are half-and-half Republic and Soviet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the main street of the principal settlement on Io runs an invisible
      line. On one side of the line, the principal settlement is known as New
      Pittsburgh. On the other side it is known as Nizhni-Magnitogorsk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into a miner's home in New Pittsburgh one day an eight-year-old boy named
      Grayson staggered, bleeding from the head. His eyes were swollen almost
      shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father lurched to his feet, knocking over a bottle. He looked stupidly
      at the bottle, set it upright too late to save much of the alcohol, and
      then stared fixedly at the boy. "See what you made me do, you little
      bastard?" he growled, and fetched the boy a clout on his bleeding head
      that sent him spinning against the wall of the hut. The boy got up slowly
      and silently&mdash;there seemed to be something wrong with his left arm&mdash;and
      glowered at his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fighting again," the father said, in a would-be fierce voice. His eyes
      fell under the peculiar fire in the boy's stare. "Damn fool&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman came in from the kitchen. She was tall and thin. In a flat voice
      she said to the man: "Get out of here." The man hiccupped and said: "Your
      brat spilled my bottle. Gimme a dollar."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same flat voice: "I have to buy food."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I said gimme a dollar!</i>" The man slapped her face&mdash;it did not
      change&mdash;and wrenched a small purse from the string that suspended it
      around her neck. The boy suddenly was a demon, flying at his father with
      fists and teeth. It lasted only a second or two. The father kicked him
      into a corner where he lay, still glaring, wordless and dry-eyed. The
      mother had not moved; her husband's handmark was still red on her face
      when he hulked out, clutching the money bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grayson at last crouched in the corner with the eight-year-old boy.
      "Little Tommy," she said softly. "My little Tommy! Did you cross the line
      again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was blubbering in her arms, hysterically, as she caressed him. At last
      he was able to say: "I didn't cross the line, Mom. Not this time. It was
      in school. They said our name was really Krasinsky. God-damn him!" the boy
      shrieked. "They said his grandfather was named Krasinsky and he moved over
      the line and changed his name to Grayson! God-damn him! Doing that to us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, darling," his mother said, caressing him. "Now, darling." His
      trembling began to ebb. She said: "Let's get out the spools, Tommy. You
      mustn't fall behind in school. You owe that to me, don't you, darling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mom," he said. He threw his spindly arms around her and kissed her.
      "Get out the spools. We'll show him. I mean them."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      President Folsom XXIV lay on his death-bed, feeling no pain, mostly
      because his personal physician had pumped him full of morphine. Dr. Barnes
      sat by the bed holding the presidential wrist and waiting, occasionally
      nodding off and recovering with a belligerent stare around the room. The
      four wire-service men didn't care whether he fell asleep or not; they were
      worriedly discussing the nature and habits of the President's first-born,
      who would shortly succeed to the highest office in the Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A firebrand, they tell me," the A.P. man said unhappily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Firebrands I don't mind," the U.P. man said. "He can send out all the
      inflammatory notes he wants just as long as he isn't a fiend for exercise.
      I'm not as young as I once was. You boys wouldn't remember the <i>old</i>
      President, Folsom XXII. He used to do point-to-point hiking. He worshipped
      old F.D.R."
    </p>
    <p>
      The I.N.S. man said, lowering his voice: "Then he was worshipping the
      wrong Roosevelt. Teddy was the athlete."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Barnes started, dropped the presidential wrist and held a mirror to
      the mouth for a moment. "Gentlemen," he said, "the President is dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O.K.," the A.P. man said. "Let's go, boys. I'll send in the flash. U.P.,
      you go cover the College of Electors. I.N.S., get onto the President
      Elect. Trib, collect some interviews and background&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened abruptly; a colonel of infantry was standing there,
      breathing hard, with an automatic rifle at port. "Is he dead?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," the A.P. man said. "If you'll let me past&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody leaves the room," the colonel said grimly. "I represent General
      Slocum, Acting President of the Republic. The College of Electors is
      acting now to ratify&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      A burst of gunfire caught the colonel in the back; he spun and fell, with
      a single hoarse cry. More gunfire sounded through the White House. A
      Secret Serviceman ducked his head through the door: "President's dead? You
      boys stay put. We'll have this thing cleaned up in an hour&mdash;" He
      vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor sputtered his alarm and the newsmen ignored him with
      professional poise. The A.P. man asked: "Now who's Slocum? Defense
      Command?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I.N.S. said: "I remember him. Three stars. He headed up the Tactical
      Airborne Force out in Kansas four-five years ago. I think he was retired
      since then."
    </p>
    <p>
      A phosphorus grenade crashed through the window and exploded with a globe
      of yellow flame the size of a basketball; dense clouds of phosphorus
      pentoxide gushed from it and the sprinkler system switched on, drenching
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on!" hacked the A.P. man, and they scrambled from the room and
      slammed the door. The doctor's coat was burning in two or three places,
      and he was retching feebly on the corridor floor. They tore his coat off
      and flung it back into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The U.P. man, swearing horribly, dug a sizzling bit of phosphorus from the
      back of his hand with a pen-knife and collapsed, sweating, when it was
      out. The I.N.S. man passed him a flask and he gurgled down half a pint of
      liquor. "Who flang that brick?" he asked faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody," the A.P. man said gloomily. "That's the hell of it. None of this
      is happening. Just the way Taft the Pretender never happened in '03. Just
      the way the Pentagon Mutiny never happened in '67."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'68," the U.P. man said faintly. "It didn't happen in '68, not '67."
    </p>
    <p>
      The A.P. man smashed a fist into the palm of his hand and swore. "<i>God</i>-damn,"
      he said. "Some day I'd like to&mdash;" He broke off and was bitterly
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The U.P. man must have been a little dislocated with shock and quite drunk
      to talk the way he did. "Me too," he said. "Like to tell the story. Maybe
      it was '67 not '68. I'm not sure now. Can't write it down so the details
      get lost and then after a while it didn't happen at all. Revolution'd be
      good deal. But it takes people t' make revolution. <i>People.</i> With
      eyes 'n ears. 'N memories. We make things not-happen an' we make people
      not-see an' not-hear...." He slumped back against the corridor wall,
      nursing his burned hand. The others were watching him, very scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the A.P. man caught sight of the Secretary of Defense striding down
      the corridor, flanked by Secret Servicemen. "Mr. Steiner!" he called.
      "What's the picture?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Steiner stopped, breathing heavily, and said: "Slocum's barricaded in the
      Oval Study. They don't want to smash in. He's about the only one left.
      There were only fifty or so. The Acting President's taken charge at the
      Study. You want to come along?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They did, and even hauled the U.P. man after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Acting President, who would be President Folsom XXV as soon as the
      Electoral College got around to it, had his father's face&mdash;the
      petulant lip, the soft jowl&mdash;on a hard young body. He also had an
      auto-rifle ready to fire from the hip. Most of the Cabinet was present.
      When the Secretary of Defense arrived, he turned on him. "Steiner," he
      said nastily, "can you explain why there should be a rebellion against the
      Republic in your department?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. President," Steiner said, "Slocum was retired on my recommendation
      two years ago. It seems to me that my responsibility ended there and
      Security should have taken over."
    </p>
    <p>
      The President Elect's finger left the trigger of the auto-rifle and his
      lip drew in a little. "Quite so," he said curtly, and, turned to the door.
      "Slocum!" he shouted. "Come out of there. We can use gas if we want."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The door opened unexpectedly and a tired-looking man with three stars on
      each shoulder stood there, bare-handed. "All right," he said drearily. "I
      was fool enough to think something could be done about the regime. But you
      fat-faced imbeciles are going to go on and on and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The stutter of the auto-rifle cut him off. The President Elect's knuckles
      were white as he clutched the piece's forearm and grip; the torrent of
      slugs continued to hack and plow the general's body until the magazine was
      empty. "Burn that," he said curtly, turning his back on it. "Dr. Barnes,
      come here. I want to know about my father's passing."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, hoarse and red-eyed from the whiff of phosphorus smoke, spoke
      with him. The U.P. man had sagged drunkenly into a chair, but the other
      newsmen noted that Dr. Barnes glanced at them as he spoke, in a
      confidential murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Doctor," the President Elect said at last, decisively. He
      gestured to a Secret Serviceman. "Take those traitors away." They went,
      numbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Secretary of State cleared his throat. "Mr. President," he said, "I
      take this opportunity to submit the resignations of myself and fellow
      Cabinet members according to custom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right," the President Elect said. "You may as well stay on. I
      intend to run things myself anyway." He hefted the auto-rifle. "You," he
      said to the Secretary of Public Opinion. "You have some work to do. Have
      the memory of my father's&mdash;artistic&mdash;preoccupations obliterated
      as soon as possible. I wish the Republic to assume a war-like posture&mdash;yes;
      what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A trembling messenger said: "Mr. President, I have the honor to inform you
      that the College of Electors has elected you President of the Republic&mdash;unanimously."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Cadet Fourth-Classman Thomas Grayson lay on his bunk and sobbed in an
      agony of loneliness. The letter from his mother was crumpled in his hand:
      "&mdash;prouder than words can tell of your appointment to the Academy.
      Darling, I hardly knew my grandfather but I know that you will serve as
      brilliantly as he did, to the eternal credit of the Republic. You must be
      brave and strong for my sake&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have given everything he had or ever could hope to have to be
      back with her, and away from the bullying, sneering fellow-cadets of the
      Corps. He kissed the letter&mdash;and then hastily shoved it under his
      mattress as he heard footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      He popped to a brace, but it was only his roommate Ferguson. Ferguson was
      from Earth, and rejoiced in the lighter Lunar gravity which was punishment
      to Grayson's Io-bred muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rest, mister," Ferguson grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thought it was night inspection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any minute now. They're down the hall. Lemme tighten your bunk or you'll
      be in trouble&mdash;" Tightening the bunk he pulled out the letter and
      said, calvishly: "Ah-<i>hah</i>! Who is she?&mdash;" and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the cadet officers reached the room they found Ferguson on the floor
      being strangled black in the face by spidery little Grayson. It took all
      three of them to pull him off. Ferguson went to the infirmary and Grayson
      went to the Commandant's office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commandant glared at the cadet from under the most spectacular pair of
      eyebrows in the Service. "Cadet Grayson," he said, "explain what
      occurred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, Cadet Ferguson began to read a letter from my mother without my
      permission."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not accepted by the Corps as grounds for mayhem. Do you have
      anything further to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I lost my temper. All I thought of was that it was an act of
      disrespect to my mother and somehow to the Corps and the Republic too&mdash;that
      Cadet Ferguson was dishonoring the Corps."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bushwah</i>, the Commandant thought. <i>A snow job and a crude one.</i>
      He studied the youngster. He had never seen such a brace from an Io-bred
      fourth-classman. It must be torture to muscles not yet toughened up to
      even Lunar gravity. Five minutes more and the boy would have to give way,
      and serve him right for showing off.
    </p>
    <p>
      He studied Grayson's folder. It was too early to tell about academic work,
      but the fourth-classman was a bear&mdash;or a fool&mdash;for extra duty.
      He had gone out for half a dozen teams and applied for membership in the
      exacting Math Club <i>and</i> Writing Club. The Commandant glanced up;
      Grayson was still in his extreme brace. The Commandant suddenly had the
      queer idea that Grayson could hold it until it killed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One hundred hours of pack-drill," he barked, "to be completed before
      quarter-term. Cadet Grayson, if you succeed in walking off your tours,
      remember that there is a tradition of fellowship in the Corps which its
      members are expected to observe. Dismiss."
    </p>
    <p>
      After Grayson's steel-sharp salute and exit the Commandant dug deeper into
      the folder. Apparently there was something wrong with the boy's left arm,
      but it had been passed by the examining team that visited Io. Most
      unusual. Most irregular. But nothing could be done about it now.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The President, softer now in body than on his election day, and infinitely
      more cautious, snapped: "It's all very well to create an incident. But
      where's the money to come from? Who wants the rest of Io anyway? And what
      will happen if there's war?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Treasury said: "The hoarders will supply the money, Mr. President. A
      system of percentage-bounties for persons who report currency-hoarders,
      and then enforced purchase of a bond issue."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raw materials said: "We need that iron, Mr. President. We need it
      desperately."
    </p>
    <p>
      State said: "All our evaluations indicate that the Soviet Premier would
      consider nothing less than armed invasion of his continental borders as
      occasion for all-out war. The consumer-goods party in the Soviet has
      gained immensely during the past five years and of course their armaments
      have suffered. Your shrewd directive to put the Republic in a war-like
      posture has borne fruit, Mr. President...."
    </p>
    <p>
      President Folsom XXV studied them narrowly. To him the need for a border
      incident culminating in a forced purchase of Soviet Io did not seem as
      pressing as they thought, but they were, after all, specialists. And there
      was no conceivable way they could benefit from it personally. The only
      alternative was that they were offering their professional advice and that
      it would be best to heed it. Still, there was a vague, nagging
      something....
    </p>
    <p>
      Nonsense, he decided. The spy dossiers on his Cabinet showed nothing but
      the usual. One had been blackmailed by an actress after an affair and
      railroaded her off the Earth. Another had a habit of taking bribes to
      advance favorite sons in civil and military service. And so on. The
      Republic could not suffer at their hands; the Republic and the dynasty
      were impregnable. You simply spied on everybody&mdash;including the spies&mdash;and
      ordered summary executions often enough to show that you meant it, and
      kept the public ignorant: deaf-dumb-blind ignorant. The spy system was
      simplicity itself; you had only to let things get as tangled and confused
      as possible until <i>nobody</i> knew who was who. The executions were
      literally no problem, for guilt or innocence made no matter. And
      mind-control when there were four newspapers, six magazines and three
      radio and television stations was a job for a handful of clerks.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; the Cabinet couldn't be getting away with anything. The system was
      unbeatable.
    </p>
    <p>
      President Folsom XXV said: "Very well. Have it done."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Mrs. Grayson, widow, of New Pittsburgh, Io, disappeared one night. It was
      in all the papers and on all the broadcasts. Some time later she was found
      dragging herself back across the line between Nizhni-Magnitogorsk and New
      Pittsburgh in sorry shape. She had a terrible tale to tell about what she
      had suffered at the hands and so forth of the Nizhni-Magnitogorskniks. A
      diplomatic note from the Republic to the Soviet was answered by another
      note which was answered by the dispatch of the Republic's First Fleet to
      Io which was answered by the dispatch of the Soviet's First and Fifth
      Fleets to Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Republic's First Fleet blew up the customary deserted target hulk,
      fulminated over a sneak sabotage attack and moved in its destroyers.
      Battle was joined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ensign Thomas Grayson took over the command of his destroyer when its
      captain was killed on his bridge. An electrified crew saw the strange,
      brooding youngster perform prodigies of skill and courage, and responded
      to them. In one week of desultory action the battered destroyer had
      accounted for seven Soviet destroyers and a cruiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as this penetrated to the flagship, Grayson was decorated and
      given a flotilla. His weird magnetism extended to every officer and man
      aboard the seven craft. They struck like phantoms, cutting out cruisers
      and battlewagons in wild unorthodox actions that couldn't have succeeded
      but did&mdash;every time. Grayson was badly wounded twice, but his driving
      nervous energy carried him through.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was decorated again and given the battlewagon of an ailing
      four-striper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without orders he touched down on the Soviet side of Io, led out a landing
      party of marines and bluejackets, cut through two regiments of Soviet
      infantry, and returned to his battlewagon with prisoners: the top civil
      and military administrators of Soviet Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      They discussed him nervously aboard the flagship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has a mystical quality, Admiral. His men would follow him into an
      atomic furnace. And&mdash;and I almost believe he could bring them through
      safely if he wanted to." The laugh was nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He doesn't look like much. But when he turns on the charm&mdash;watch
      out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's&mdash;he's a <i>winner</i>. Now I wonder what I mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know what you mean. They turn up every so often. People who can't be
      stopped. People who have everything. Napoleons. Alexanders. Stalins. Up
      from nowhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suleiman. Hitler. Folsom I. Jenghis Khan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let's get it over with."
    </p>
    <p>
      They tugged at their gold-braided jackets and signalled the honor guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grayson was piped aboard, received another decoration and another speech.
      This time he made a speech in return.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      President Folsom XXV, not knowing what else to do, had summoned his
      cabinet. "Well?" he rasped at the Secretary of Defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steiner said with a faint shrug: "Mr. President, there is nothing to be
      done. He has the fleet, he has the broadcasting facilities, he has the
      people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "People!" snarled the President. His finger stabbed at a button and the
      wall panels snapped down to show the Secret Servicemen standing in their
      niches. The finger shot tremulously out at Steiner. "Kill that traitor!"
      he raved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief of the detail said uneasily: "Mr. President, we were listening
      to Grayson before we came on duty. He says he's de facto President now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kill him! Kill him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief went doggedly on: "&mdash;and we liked what he had to say about
      the Republic and he said citizens of the Republic shouldn't take orders
      from you and he'd relieve you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The President fell back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grayson walked in, wearing his plain ensign's uniform and smiling faintly.
      Admirals and four-stripers flanked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief of the detail said: "Mr. Grayson! Are you taking over?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the ensign's uniform said gravely: "Yes. And just call me
      'Grayson,' please. The titles come later. You can go now."
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief gave a pleased grin and collected his detail. The rather slight,
      youngish man who had something wrong with one arm was in charge&mdash;<i>complete</i>
      charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grayson said: "Mr. Folsom, you are relieved of the presidency. Captain,
      take him out and&mdash;" He finished with a whimsical shrug. A portly
      four-striper took Folsom by one arm. Like a drugged man the deposed
      president let himself be led out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grayson looked around the table. "Who are you gentlemen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They felt his magnetism, like the hum when you pass a power station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steiner was the spokesman. "Grayson," he said soberly, "We were Folsom's
      Cabinet. However, there is more that we have to tell you. Alone, if you
      will allow it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, gentlemen." Admirals and captains backed out, looking
      concerned.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Steiner said: "Grayson, the story goes back many years. My predecessor,
      William Malvern, determined to overthrow the regime, holding that it was
      an affront to the human spirit. There have been many such attempts. All
      have broken up on the rocks of espionage, terrorism and opinion-control&mdash;the
      three weapons which the regime holds firmly in its hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Malvern tried another approach than espionage versus espionage, terrorism
      versus terrorism and opinion-control versus opinion-control. He determined
      to use the basic fact that certain men make history: that there are men
      born to be mould-breakers. They are the Phillips of Macedon, the
      Napoleons, Stalins and Hitlers, the Suleimans&mdash;the adventurers. Again
      and again they flash across history, bringing down an ancient empire,
      turning ordinary soldiers of the line into unkillable demons of battle,
      uprooting cultures, breathing new life into moribund peoples.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are common denominators among all the adventurers. Intelligence, of
      course. Other things are more mysterious but are always present. They are
      foreigners. Napoleon the Corsican. Hitler the Austrian. Stalin the
      Georgian. Phillip the Macedonian. Always there is an Oedipus complex.
      Always there is physical deficiency. Napoleon's stature. Stalin's withered
      arm&mdash;and yours. Always there is a minority disability, real or
      fancied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a shock to you, Grayson, but you must face it. <i>You were
      manufactured.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Malvern packed the cabinet with the slyest double-dealers he could find
      and they went to work. Eighty-six infants were planted on the outposts of
      the Republic in simulated family environments. Your mother was not your
      mother but one of the most brilliant actresses ever to drop out of sight
      on Earth. Your intelligence-heredity was so good that we couldn't turn you
      down for lack of a physical deficiency. We withered your arm with gamma
      radiation. I hope you will forgive us. There was no other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the eighty-six you are the one that worked. Somehow the combination
      for you was minutely different from all the other combinations,
      genetically or environmentally, and it worked. That is all we were after.
      The mould has been broken, you know now what you are. Let come whatever
      chaos is to come; the dead hand of the past no longer lies on&mdash;"
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Grayson went to the door and beckoned; two captains came in. Steiner broke
      off his speech as Grayson said to them: "These men deny my godhood. Take
      them out and&mdash;" he finished with a whimsical shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, your divinity," said the captains, without a trace of humor in their
      voices.
